# Pricing in Ride-share Platforms: A Queueing-Theoretic Approach
The computational analysis of the research paper: [Pricing in Ride-share Platforms: A Queueing-Theoretic Approach](http://www.columbia.edu/~ww2040/8100F16/Riquelme-Johari-Banerjee.pdf)

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy
```

## Structure 
Two different platform pricing strategies are used:
* Static Pricing
* Dynamic Pricing | Single-Threshold Pricing 
The underlying equations are used to replicate the figures in the large market limit.
Furthermore, an Agent-based model is used and benchmarked against the theoretic results

## Static Pricing
### Theoretic
Run *static_theoretic.main()* from [main.py](main.py)
